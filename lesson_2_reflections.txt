What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the appropriate git files that keep track of changes made to the files within the directory.  You need to do it to start the process of keeping track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area isnâ€™t permanent and is the area where you decide what is going to be committed.  It lets you pick and choose what to commit instead of having to commit every change you made.
